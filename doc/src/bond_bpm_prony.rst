Description
"""""""""""

The *bpm/prony* bond style computes forces based on
deviations from the initial reference state of the two atoms, strain and stress history. The
reference length :math:`r_0` is stored by each bond when it is first computed in
the setup of a run. Initially, the previous length of the bond :math:`r^{t-1}`
is set equal to :math:`r_0` but evolves during the run. Data is then preserved across
run commands and is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>` such that restarting
the system will not reset the reference and previous states of a bond.

This bond style only applies central-body forces which conserve the
translational and rotational degrees of freedom of a bonded set of
particles. The bond force follows a linear viscoelastic formulation based 
on a generalized Maxwell element, as outlined in :ref:`(Kaliske) <Kaliske1>`. 
The bond force has a magnitude of

.. math::

   F = w (F_{el} + H_d)

where :math:`F_{el}` is the force contribution from the rate-independent
elastic element, and :math:`H_{d}` is the contribution from the rate-dependent 
viscoelastic (Maxwell) elements, and :math:`w` is an optional smoothing factor discussed below.
The elastic force has a magnitude of

.. math::

   F_{el} = k_0 (r - r_0)

where :math:`k_0` is a stiffness, :math:`r` is the current distance
and :math:`r_0` is the initial distance between the two particles.
The viscoelastic force has a magnitude of

.. math::

   H_{d} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} h_j^t

where the total viscoelastic force is the sum of :math:`j = 1` to :math:`n` 
Maxwell elements. The force contributed by each :math:`j`-th Maxwell element
at the current timestep :math:`t` is given as

.. math::

   h_j^t = \exp{ \left(\frac{-k_j \Delta t}{\eta_j}\right)} h_j^{t-1} + \frac{\eta_j}{\Delta t} \left[1 - \exp{\left(\frac{-k_j \Delta t}{\eta_j}\right)} \right] (r^{t-1} - r)

where :math:`k_j` is a stiffness, :math:`\eta_j` is a viscosity, :math:`\Delta t` is the timestep,
:math:`r^{t-1}` is the previous bond length, :math:`r` is the current bond length, and :math:`h_j^{t-1}`
is the viscoelastic force from the previous timestep. The stiffness and viscosity coefficients for the
Maxwell elements are stored in a tabulated file. Note that as defined in the formula
the viscosity :math:`\eta_j` really has units of (force*time units). It would need to be divided 
by a per-bond area to have units of (pressure * time), but a bonds area is not well defined or
easy to compute.

Bonds will break at a strain of :math:`\epsilon_c`.  This is done by setting
the bond type to 0 such that forces are no longer computed.

An additional damping force is applied to the bonded
particles.  This force is proportional to the difference in the
normal velocity of particles using a similar construction as
dissipative particle dynamics :ref:`(Groot) <Groot4>`:

.. math::

   F_d = - \gamma w (\hat{r} \bullet \vec{v})

where :math:`\gamma` is the damping strength, :math:`\hat{r}` is the
radial normal vector, and :math:`\vec{v}` is the velocity difference
between the two particles.

The smoothing factor :math:`w` can be added or removed by setting the
*smooth* keyword to *yes* or *no*, respectively. It is constructed such
that forces smoothly go to zero, avoiding discontinuities, as bonds
approach the critical strain

.. math::

   w = 1.0 - \left( \frac{r - r_0}{r_0 \epsilon_c} \right)^8 .

If the *normalize* keyword is set to *yes*, the bond force will be
normalized by :math:`r_0` such that :math:`k_0` and :math:`k_j` must all be given in force units.

By default, pair forces are not calculated between bonded particles.
Pair forces can alternatively be overlaid on top of bond forces by setting
the *overlay/pair* keyword to *yes*. These settings require specific
:doc:`special_bonds <special_bonds>` settings described in the
restrictions.  Further details can be found in the :doc:`how to <Howto_bpm>`
page on BPMs.

If the *break* keyword is set to *no*, LAMMPS assumes bonds should not break
during a simulation run. This will prevent some unnecessary calculation.
The recommended bond communication distance no longer depends on the value of
:math:`\epsilon_c` (which is ignored) but instead corresponds to the typical
heuristic maximum strain used by typical non-bpm bond styles. Similar behavior
to *break no* can also be attained by setting an arbitrarily high value of
:math:`\epsilon_c`. One cannot use *break no* with *smooth yes*.

The *plastic* keyword toggles whether the elastic element is allowed to plastically
deform as done by :doc:`bpm/spring/plastic <bond_bpm_spring_plastic>`. If set to *yes* the elastic
force has a magnitude of

.. math::
   F_{el} = k_0 (r - r_{eq})

where :math:`r_{eq}` is the equlibrium bond length.
If the bond stretches beyond a strain of :math:`\epsilon_p` in compression or extension, 
it will plastically activate and :math:`r_{eq}` will evolve to ensure :math:`|(r-r_{eq})/r_{eq}|`
never exceeds :math:`r_{eq}`. Therefore, if a bond is continually loaded in either tension or compression, 
the force in the elastic element will initially grow elastically before plateauing. Similar behaviour to 
*plastic no* can be achieved by setting an arbitrarily high value of :math:`\epsilon_p`, or a higher value
than :math:`\epsilon_c` if the *break yes* option is enabled.

The *nonlinear* keyword toggles whether the force in the elastic element is nonlinear. The form
of this is chosen such that the stiffness is :math:`k_{0}` for small applied strains, and diverges as
bonds approach a critcal stretch :math:`\lambda_{c}`.
If set to *yes* the elastic force has a magnitude of

.. math::
   F_{el} = k_0 (r - r_0)\left[ \frac{1}{1-\lambda^{2}} \right]

where :math:`\lambda = (r - r_{0})/(r_{c}-r_{0})` is the stretch ratio with
:math:`r_{0}` the reference bond length. The critical length :math:`r_{c}` in tension 
is simply :math:`\lambda_c r_{0}`, meanwhile in compression :math:`r_{c}` = :math:`0`.
If additionally, *plastic* = *yes* the reference state :math:`r_0`
is replaced by the equlibrium state :math:`r_{eq}` as outlined above.

The *temp/shift* keyword toggles whether the shift factor is used. This multiplicatively 
adjusts the viscoelastic timescale as

.. math::
   \eta_m = a_T \eta^0_m

where :math:`\eta_m^0` are the viscosities of the Maxwell elements as specified in 
the tabulated file, and :math:`eta_m` are the shifted viscosities used during a simulation.
This can be used to essentially freeze relaxation of the internal stress during loading for
instance. Alternatively, the shift factor :math:`a_T` is accessible by the
:doc:`fix_adapt <fix_adapt>` command which allows :math:`a_T` to be modified continuously
during a simulation.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
:doc:`bond_coeff <bond_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data
<read_data>` or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* :math:`k_0`            (force/distance units)
* :math:`\epsilon_c`     (unitless)
* :math:`\gamma`         (force/velocity units)
* filename
* keyword
* :math:`\epsilon_p`      (unitless)
* :math:`\lambda_c`       (unitless)
* :math:`a_T`             (unitless)

The filename specifies a file containing the tablulated coefficients for the Maxwell 
elements. The keyword specifies a section of the file. The format of this file is described below.

If the *store/local* keyword is used, an internal fix will track bonds that
break during the simulation. Whenever a bond breaks, data is processed
and transferred to an internal fix labeled *fix_ID*. This allows the
local data to be accessed by other LAMMPS commands. Following this optional
keyword, a list of one or more attributes is specified.  These include the
IDs of the two atoms in the bond. The other attributes for the two atoms
include the timestep during which the bond broke and the current/initial
center of mass position of the two atoms.

Data is continuously accumulated over intervals of *N*
timesteps. At the end of each interval, all of the saved accumulated
data is deleted to make room for new data. Individual datum may
therefore persist anywhere between *1* to *N* timesteps depending on
when they are saved. This data can be accessed using the *fix_ID* and a
:doc:`dump local <dump>` command. To ensure all data is output,
the dump frequency should correspond to the same interval of *N*
timesteps. A dump frequency of an integer multiple of *N* can be used
to regularly output a sample of the accumulated data.

Note that when unbroken bonds are dumped to a file via the
:doc:`dump local <dump>` command, bonds with type 0 (broken bonds)
are not included.
The :doc:`delete_bonds <delete_bonds>` command can also be used to
query the status of broken bonds or permanently delete them, e.g.:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   delete_bonds all stats
   delete_bonds all bond 0 remove

----------

Formatting the table file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The format of a tabulated file is as follows (without parenthesized comments):

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   # Coefficients for Maxwell elements  (one or more comment or blank lines)
   
   MAXWELL                              (keyword is the first text on line)
   n 5                                  (n Maxwell elements/entries)
                                        (blank line)
   1 1.0 0.1                            (index, stiffness, viscosity)
   2 2.0 100
   ...
   5 0.5 1.0

The number of parameters *n* defined in the table file must be less than or 
equal to the number of entries *N* allocated via the :doc:`bond_style <bond_style>` command.
Therefore, if each bond type uses a unique tabulated file, *N* 
should be allocated according to the file with the largest number of tabulated entries.

----------

Restart and other info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This bond style writes the reference state of each bond to
:doc:`binary restart files <restart>`. Loading a restart
file will properly restore bonds. However, the reference state is NOT
written to data files. Therefore reading a data file will not
restore bonds and will cause their reference states to be redefined.

If the *store/local* option is used, an internal fix will calculate
a local vector or local array depending on the number of input values.
The length of the vector or number of rows in the array is the number
of recorded, broken bonds.  If a single input is specified, a local
vector is produced. If two or more inputs are specified, a local array
is produced where the number of columns = the number of inputs.  The
vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses local values
from a compute as input. See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The vector or array will be floating point values that correspond to
the specified attribute.

Any settings with the *store/local* option are not saved to a restart
file and must be redefined.

The single() function of this bond style returns 0.0 for the energy of a 
bonded interaction, since energy is not conserved in these dissipative potentials. 
However, the single() function also calculates 4 additional quantities. The first 2 pertain 
to bond lengths, including the reference state :math:`r_0` and equlibrium state :math:`r_{eq}`
if the *plastic* option is utilized. If *plastic* = *no* then the equlibrium state 
:math:`r_{eq}` will equal the reference state :math:`r_0`.
The next 2 quantites (3-4) are the split elastic :math:`F_{el}`
and viscoelastic :math:`H_d` forces respectively.

These extra quantity can be accessed by the
:doc:`compute bond/local <compute_bond_local>` command as *b1*, *b2*, ..., *b4* \.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This bond style is part of the BPM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info.

By default if pair interactions between bonded atoms are to be disabled,
this bond style requires setting

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   special_bonds lj 0 1 1 coul 1 1 1

and :doc:`newton <newton>` must be set to bond off.  If the *overlay/pair*
keyword is set to *yes*, this bond style alternatively requires setting

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   special_bonds lj/coul 1 1 1
